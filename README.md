# React + Vite

This repository is to track the project given as assignment.

To run the project perform following tasks :
-> Clone the repo
-> Move inside the "blog_app_assignment" folder
-> Execute: "npm install"
-> Execute: "npm run server" (to start the json-server on port 8000 and make it watch db.json file)
-> Execute: "npm run dev" (to start react client using vite)

-> For login enter any text email (valid) and password.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
